# Simple Vite Template

## You vison is your path

Template created to provide clarity in creating a simple webpage with the assistance of external dependencies. The main objective is to serve as a tool for facilitating the utilization of components and modules in HTML projects.

This template was developed using Vite.js, DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS Components), and the capability to easily include external libraries like Swiper.

> **Compatibility Note:**
> Vite requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 14.18+, 16+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.
